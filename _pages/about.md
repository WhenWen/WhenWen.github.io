Nice Met! I am Kaiyue Wen (温凯越). I am a junior-year undergraduate student at Yao's pilot class in computer science and engineering at Tsinghua University. Here are my [CV](https://github.com/WhenWen/WhenWen.github.io/blob/master/files/CVofKaiyueWen.pdf) and [‪Kaiyue Wen‬ - ‪Google Scholar‬](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oTmQCFUAAAAJ).

My research interest spreads broadly in machine learning, including theory and downstream applications. I've been particularly drawn to exploring language models, with a focus on gaining a mechanistic understanding with a complementary blend of empirical and theoretical methods.
