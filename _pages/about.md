As a junior student at Yao Class IIIS Tsinghua University majoring in Computer Science, I am passionately pursuing my research interests that span multiple areas of machine learning.

Theoretically, my curiosity is piqued by the optimization dynamics of deep neural networks and the implicit bias that different optimization methods yield. In addition, I have conducted research on statistics and causality, which I believe are vital for unlocking the full potential of machine learning.

My current empirical research centers on developing a granular understanding of natural language processing models, with a focus on analyzing the behavior of individual components. Additionally, I am also involved in an interdisciplinary project that leverages machine learning in cryptography, which has been an exciting and rewarding experience.

If my research interests align with yours, I would love to hear from you! Please feel free to contact me via email to discuss any opportunities or collaborations.
