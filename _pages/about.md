Hi! I am a junior-year undergraduate student at Yao's pilot class in computer science and engineering at Tsinghua University.

My research interest spreads broadly in machine learning, including theory and downstream applications. I've been particularly drawn to exploring pretrained language models in-depth, with a focus on gaining a mechanistic understanding of how they work with a complementary blend of empirical and theoretical methods.

If my research interests align with yours, I would love to hear from you! Please feel free to contact me via email to discuss any opportunities or collaborations.
