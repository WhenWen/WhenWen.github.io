Hello! I am Kaiyue Wen. I am a senior-year undergraduate student at Yao's pilot class studying computer science and engineering at Tsinghua University. Here are my [CV](https://whenwen.github.io/files/CVofKaiyueWen.pdf) and [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oTmQCFUAAAAJ).

My research interest spreads broadly in machine learning, including theory and downstream applications, with a particular interest in exploring large language models. My recent research focus can be characterized as follows.

1. *Macroscopic Level.* I am interested in better utilizing large language models, including but not limited to, improving robustness, controllability, and reasoning ability, through building systems around current models through first-principle analysis and theoretical understanding.
2. *MIcroscopic Level.* I am interested in understanding the training dynamics of large language models, including but not limited to, the generalization ability, the implicit bias, and the optimization dynamics of pretraining, through theoretical analysis and empirical study.

I believe that the two levels are closely related and mutually beneficial. I am applying for Phd position starting at 2024. Please contact me through email if you are interested!
