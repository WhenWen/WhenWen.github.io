这里是温凯越。

I'm currently a sophomore student at Yao Class Tsinghua University, major in Computer Science.

I'm interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence from both theoretical and practical perspectives and are currently actively learning relative materials, including NLP as an experimentalist  and Statistical Learning as a student.

I have participated in Mathematics Olympiad in my high school years.

I'm a sci-fi fan and a proud whovian.

Currently I am focusing on a project involving Prompt Tuning at Tsinghua Natural Language Processing Lab.

I am planning to update some reading notes in the blogs.

Feel free to contact me via email!
