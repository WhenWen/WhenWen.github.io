这里是温凯越。

I'm currently a junior student at Yao Class IIIS Tsinghua University, major in Computer Science.

My research interest spans across multiple areas on machine learning. 

Theoretically, I am interested in the optimization dynamics of deep neural networks and the implicit bias different optimization methods yield.
I am also conducting research on statistics and causality.

Empirically, I mainly focus on neuron level understanding of natural language processing model. 
I am also working on an interdisciplinary project leveraging machine learning in cryptography.
